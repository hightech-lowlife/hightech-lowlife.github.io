# Introduction

I wasn't really planning on building another e-bike so quickly, but one of my coworkers just gave me this little BMX ebike. It's super cheap, he bought it at Walmart for like $90, it's actually not that bad! I was impressed for what you can get for $100, it even has one of those trick rotating rear brake couplers that allows you to do bar spins without binding up your cables ~ pretty cool. 

I started out this build just wanting to make a grocery-getter, something small that I could ride to the local grocery store on my break from work to pick up some food. I also was just planning on making it a beater so that if something happened to it, I wasn't going to be too upset about it. Of course I was planning on just throwing some parts at it and building it as quickly as possible, but it never turns out that way, so I ended up pouring way too much time into it and making it 'too nice'.

## parts list

1. Bicycle ~ Walmart ~ I would link it, but of course they don't sell it anymore, it's a Walmart adult BMX bike, just look on their site for that and you'll find something comparable. 
2. Motor / Controller ~ [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32268426912.html) This is a 72V 2000W kit, but I asked the seller for an IPS display and they said the only controller they had was upgraded to 50A, I was fine with that. This puts this kit at 3500W! Which is just crazy to bolt onto a tiny BMX bike
3. Battery ~ 72V 13.2AH ~ I don't recommend the pack I bought, you're better off just getting a 'full' pack instead of what I (unexpectedly) got, which is just a bunch of smaller packs jumbled together. 

I bought a bunch of other little parts to make this work, extra universal brake kits (front and rear), various nuts and bolts, etc.

Anyway, here is a timeline of Windows releases with their taskbar front and cente... well, front and bottom.
