# Cosmetic Modifications

In part 4 we're digging into all of the cosmetic modifications I have planned for this build. I actually didn't really plan on putting too much time or work into making this look nice, this was supposed to be a 'beater' that I could thrash on, but that didn't really work out, so here I am pouring way too much time and energy into another build!

![](cad.jpg)
First up is mocking up the 'placards', I had an idea of hiding some of the wires behind some opaque acrylic panels - so I just measured them up with some CAD (cardboard aided design).

I also wanted to put one on the front to pay homage to my favorite 80's BMX movie - RAD

![](emb.jpg)
Next up was working on this stupid bag some more! I thought for sure that this was just an embroidered 'badge' that they then sewed on to the bag, but this was not the case. The actually embroidered the bag, I couldn't believe it. It took me 2.5 hours to remove all of the embroidery and had I known that it was going to be like this I would have just left it. 

![](after.jpg)
Finally finished, what a mess! 

![](dye.jpg)
As much as I like orange, I like black better so here I am dyeing the bag fully black. I have dyed things before, including nylon, so this should be a walk in the park. I used a full bottle of rit dye for this, so it should be as black as the abyss. 

![](rear.jpg)
While my bag is cooking in dye, it's time to install the new rear brake. Yes I had to purchase a new one because I could not reuse the old one unfortunately (try as I may). 

![](rear2.jpg)
After all of my experience with the front brake, the rear one went on very smoothly. 




![](tape.jpg)
This first thing I did was tape all of these little blue potatoes together! I got tired of carrying them around one by one, so giant brick here we go. 

![](wire.jpg)
This is 6 packs, each one is 36v and 4.4Ah, so if we wire two together that will get us 72V, and then if we parallel 3 sets of those 2 packs, that will net us 13.2Ah for run times. 

![](wire2.jpg)
I got rid of every single connector (which was a lot) and ran the wiring as cleanly and efficiently as I could to preserve room within the bag. 

![](wire3.jpg)
To get the most efficient runs, I used a single wire and only 'tapped' into it by stripping the sleeving and splitting the wire into giving me a 'hole' to run the other lead through, this made it a lot easier to solder the wires in without having a bunch of smaller lengths of wire. 

![](drill.jpg)
I needed to secure the battery tray even better, so I drilled out the tapped holes and then drilled all the way through the top tube so that I could put some much longer bolts with washers and nuts on the other side. 

![](nuts.jpg)
Securing the longer bolts with nuts on the bottom of the top tube. 

![](saw.jpg)
I got longer bolts than I needed because I knew I was going to be cutting them down to the exact size to preserve more space within the triangle. 

![](clearance.jpg)
I had to remove the washer because the tolerances right above the controller were very tight and I wanted there to be enough room so the bolt wouldn't interfere with the controller. 

![](zip.jpg)
Now that the batteries will fit in the bag, it's time to clean up some of this wiring for the motor and controller. 

![](closes.jpg)
Oh yeah, it finally zips up!!!

![](chain.jpg)
Time to put the chain back on again. 

![](pedals.jpg)
And fitting the pedals on because I want to test ride it!

![](power.jpg)
I'm putting an XT-90S connector for the discharge (to controller) and then adding a smaller XT-60 for chargining. You don't need huge power wires or connectors for charging because it's not many amps. I use the "S" versions of the XT-90 connectors because with 72v you get a loud pop and spark every time you plug them in, these spark arresting connectors take care of that. 

![](plug.jpg)
Time to plug in! 

![](ready.jpg)

Assembled and ready for a test ride!

Now that we're here I can test it out and make sure everything is working correctly before disassembling everything again and then starting on the cosmetics! 

See you next episode where we get crackin' on the visuals.
