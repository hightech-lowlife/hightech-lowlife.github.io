This is the TL;DW (too long; didn't watch) version of my 3000W BMX ebike build - for those who didn't have the time to watch the 6-part series I have condensed it all down in 'rapid-fire' pace in 6 minutes!

If you are interested in watching the much (MUCH) more detailed build videos complete with full commentary on every step of the way, please check out the playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXNw98zmL-Q&list=PLGIzSUqaQbL6U9TXgcDikVMjm-CSSoDuf

Building a custom DIY 3000W [3KW!] 45MPH monster BMX ebike! There are high speed runs, tons of glamour shots of up close details of the entire bike, and lots more riding! We have finally completed the build and there were some troubles along the way but it was well worth it in the end. 

I have a ton more builds planned in the future so please stay tuned â›§

A ton of work has gone into this bike: 
- Custom painting
- Custom acrylic side panels
- Custom acrylic placard
- Swingarm dropout 'massaging'
- Custom brakes
- Custom battery 'bag'
- 50A controller upgrade
- and much more! 

I wasn't really planning on making another ebike so quickly, but my coworker gave me this BMX bike so I figured I could turn it into a grocery getter to save from having to drive my car to the local store. I also wasn't planning on spending so much time on this build, but every time this happens I keep improving small things until the entire project has taken up so much time! 

BMX bikes will always have a soft spot in my heart, growing up as a very young kid I used to rent "RAD" on VHS all the time, with 12 year old dreams of taking a young Aunt Becky to the prom where we would do freestyle tricks in the gym while 'Send Me An Angel' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R6WIbx8ysE) blasted over the PA - if you didn't grow up in the 80's you're sorely missing out! 

This definitely isn't a guide, maybe something more to inspire you to create your own. However I will be making 'how to' and 'how to do' tutorials on how to make an ebike from start to finish in future videos.

\\ Parts \\

1. The frame
This is actually a cheap Walmart BMX bike, it only costs about $90-100 and it's actually not that bad at all. It has a cool front brake system that allows you to turn the bars all the way around without twisting up the brake cables! Nothing special here really, just a traditional steel frame. 

2. The motor
I got this kit off AliExpress, it's a 72V 2000W motor kit. I really wanted an LCD display and the controller this kit came with did not have a display, so I asked the seller if I could get one that did have it, and they said they would make me a custom kit with a different (more powerful) controller that had a display. It did cost a little bit more, but it is totally worth it to me. 

3. The controller
This is an upgraded 50A controller with a LCD (IPS) display, I believe the controller that came with this kit is only 30A or 40A, using this 50A controller pushes the output to a whopping 3500W!!!

4. The battery
I found this battery pack on eBay, I thought the packaging was the perfect dimensions for this frame as there is not a whole lot of room for almost any components given how tiny this frame is. I later realized that this 'pack' was actually just a series of 6 smaller packs, it does have 60A output, but had I know that this was configured this way, I probably would have went with a different pack as I did have to modify a lot of the wiring to make it cleaner and more robust.
