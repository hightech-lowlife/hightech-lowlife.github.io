A man rants about UI design and chaos ensues! 

## You've been using Windows taskbar wrong your whole life! (Prove me wrong!) (memE?) 

### Introduction

![](part4-headlight.jpg)
Ok so maybe that claim is a bit hyperbolic, but hear me out: monitors have changed quite a bit over time, windows taskbar has not and this is a problem. 

First let's set the stage by taking a trip down memory lane, all the way back to [1985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K38xNqZvBJI) with Windows 1.0, they didn't quite have the taskbar that we know and love (or hate) today, that would come later in Windows 95, but they did have some semblance of a taskbar and that was placed on the bottom row. 

Monitors back then were much more square than they are today, generally with an aspect ratio of 4:3. TV's were also in this rather square format as you might know from watching some killer 80's movies wondering "why are these black bars on either side of the movie!?". 

Fun fact: 
"The 4:3 motion picture aspect ratio, a.k.a. 1.33:1, was created about 120 years ago by William Kennedy Dickson. This Thomas Edison employee was developing a forerunner to the movie projector, and decided that an image height of four perforations on 35mm film gave the ideal shape. In 1909 the ratio was declared the official standard for all US films by the Motion Picture Patent Company." - [source](https://neiloseman.com/the-43-aspect-ratio-is-not-dead/)

Anyway, here is a timeline of Windows releases with their taskbar front and cente... well, front and bottom.

Do you see a trend regarding the taskbar? Yeah always on the bottom. Quite a lot of things have changed to Windows in 35+ years, a lot of updates and quality of life improvements, yet no one has paid any attention to the taskbar, this is a curious thing to me. 

Let me present my case. 

## Orientation as innovation!

Isn't this annoying? Well probably not because you're a zoomer tik-tok'r and don't even know what a desktop computer is because you've only known what a 'phone' is your whole life. But for those that can remember, when you're viewing a youtube video and someone uploads it in vertical it just totally ruins the experience and there is a reason for that. 

Perhaps if we evolved with one central eye it would make more sense to have a more 'square' viewport for visual computer interfaces, but to me it makes sense for us to naturally evolve and progress towards a more horizontal viewport. Not only do we have a pair of eyes set in a horizontal fashion, but each eye themselves have evolved to favor horizontal peripheral vision as opposed to verticality. 

I think it's a bit strange that our technological innovations have originated in this more squared format, but as I have read that had more to do with adaptations from film, but then that amakes me wonder why film started its journey in a more squared off fashion? Also, what about books? Sure, when you open the pages they conform to a horizontal format, but we certainly don't read them that way, as we bisect that horizon into two vertical planes and read them individually instead of straight across. This is also how our 'letter' paper is arranged, is there something about text that lends itself a better candidate to a more 'portrait mode' of consumption? Anothing curiousity is in antiquity famous pantings or 'portraits' are generally portrayed in 'portrait mode' (go figure) as opposed to paintings of scenery is typically more often in 'landscape' mode - makes sense, is that because scenery tends to be captured more horizontally while humans walking upright tend to show more of themselves in portrait? Seems to me that the format is adaptive to the content. Which is kind of my point! 

Are you starting to get the picture? (pun intended) Do you see where I'm going with this? 

How about some social proof? I'm just some guy. - applied science

Do we even need a taskbar? Alt-Tab
