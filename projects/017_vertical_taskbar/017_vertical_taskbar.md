A man rants about UI design and chaos ensues! 

## You've been using Windows taskbar wrong your whole life! (Prove me wrong!) 

### Introduction

Ok so maybe that claim is a bit hyperbolic, but hear me out: monitors have changed quite a bit over time, windows taskbar has not and this is a problem. 

First let's set the stage by taking a trip down memory lane, all the way back to [1985](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K38xNqZvBJI) with Windows 1.0, they didn't quite have the taskbar that we know and love (or hate) today, that would come later in Windows 95, but they did have some semblance of a taskbar and that was placed on the bottom row. 

Monitors back then were much more square than they are today, generally with an aspect ratio of 4:3. TV's were also in this rather square format as you might know from watching some killer 80's movies wondering "why are these black bars on either side of the movie!?". 

Fun fact: 
"The 4:3 motion picture aspect ratio, a.k.a. 1.33:1, was created about 120 years ago by William Kennedy Dickson. This Thomas Edison employee was developing a forerunner to the movie projector, and decided that an image height of four perforations on 35mm film gave the ideal shape. In 1909 the ratio was declared the official standard for all US films by the Motion Picture Patent Company." - [source](https://neiloseman.com/the-43-aspect-ratio-is-not-dead/)

Anyway, here is a timeline of Windows releases with their taskbar front and cente... well, bottom.

Do you see a trend regarding the taskbar? Yeah always bottom. Quite a lot of things have changed in 30 years, a lot of updates and quality of life improvements, yet no one has paid any attention to the taskbar, this is a curious thing to me. 

Let me present my case. 

## Orientation as innovation!

Isn't this annoying? Well probably not because you're a zoomer tik-tok'r and don't even know what a desktop computer is because you've only known what a 'phone' is your whole life. But for those that can remember, when you're viewing a youtube video and someone uploads it in vertical it just totally ruins the experience and there is a reason for that. Because the
