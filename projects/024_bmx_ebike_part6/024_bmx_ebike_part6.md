In part 6 we finally finish the entire build. We do have a few small things to finish up, but after that I can take it on a speed run, test ride and show it off in all it's glory! 

# Sewing Patches

![](patch.jpg)
I got these rubber patches from ![Mutiny Shop](http://www.mutinyshop.com/) to finally complete this bag. These patches are extremely tough and last a very long time, I had never bought this kind with the rubber backing before however. You're supposed to iron them on, but I was skeptical on how well I was going to be able to place these and also how well they would hold up over time. I really didn't want these flapping around after a while due to the adhesive giving way. I thought sewing them on would allow me the best placement while also being able to remove them later if I messed up. It went well, but it did take me 3+ hours to finish this! The rubber is hard to sew, plus the adhesive likes to grab the needle so it wasn't the easiest job to do but I did finish it, and it looks pretty good!

Of course I couldn't leave those 'mountain dew' neon green valve caps on there. 

# Finishing Touches

I thought I was done, and greanted this build is already graphics heavy, but these extra decals just added the final touches.
