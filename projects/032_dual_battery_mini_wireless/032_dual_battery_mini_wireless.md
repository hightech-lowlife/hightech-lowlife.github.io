Part 1 of a mini wireless keyboard build with TWO batteries! What's better than one battery in your wireless board? Obviously two!

This all started back when I first made my wireless conversion mechanical keyboard. That build had a different end goal and that was to create a sleek and 'covert' wireless conversion where you couldn't really tell from the outside that anything was modded or changed. Because of that I was limited to the interior space of the original case and that didn't leave a lot of room for the battery. 

I was able to pack in about 3000mAh of battery life, and even though this was usable and decent, I thought about how if I didn't have the constraint of the case, then I could use a much larger battery. That's when I got the idea to just make my own custom case. If I have a custom case, that means I could make the case larger which would accept a larger battery, and I guess somewhere along the way I decided that one larger battery was not enough. Since I'm making a new case anyway, why not stuff two giant batteries into the case?  

I wasn't quite sure how to do that and I've read online that wiring two power banks in parallel is a no-no. I wanted to err on the side of caution so I figured what if I just have a toggle to where I can switch between the two batteries independently? I figured this would only be annoying for that second or two that you're flipping the toggle over to the next battery and waiting for it to reconnect. I figure this is a small price to pay for literally double the wireless run time!  

This isn't really a how-to or how to do guide or anything, but if you're looking for that please check out my first wireless conversion video, as I go over a lot of the components, what they do, and how I've wired them together in that video here: https://youtu.be/o-wbPVkkyWg

I also did a wireless conversion on another 60% mechanical keyboard, and you can check that out here: https://youtu.be/2Df7Dh3-3o0

If you watch those videos first you will be fully up to speed on more of the electronic side of things that I am doing in this video üëç

## Parts 

![](01.jpg) 
Quite a few parts here, a CODE 61-key (now discontinued) backlit 60% keyboard, but essentially just a Pok3r (made by Vortex). This will be the backbone of the project, but I still need quite a few other things. 2x Getihu 10000 mAh battery banks (6000 mAh at 5V), some giant 12mm LEDs, of course the trusted Handheld Scientific BT-500 bluetooth adapter, and a USB volt meter.

Lots of power! Two pretty big battery banks.

The first thing I wanted to do was just to figure out where I was going to put these batteries. 

![](04.jpg) 
I really tried a bunch of different combinations before settling on something I thought would be the best.

Another thing I had to contend with was the dipswitches on the bottom of the PCB, I couldn't just place the batteries anywhere underneath because I need to leave room or access for this set of switches.

## Deconstruction + Test

![](06.jpg) 
I started the build by chopping down the BT-500 module, I need all the space I can get so I lopped off the USB ports as I will be directly soldering these connections.

Much better, and flatter.

Always mark your PCBs for polarity, after the 2nd time of looking it up, you'll want a label.

I'm using my trusty tiny relays to perform the switching for these tests, but I will be moving on to actual hardware toggle switches for this build. I'm just trying to make sure everything works. 

![](10.jpg)
I've never used two batteries on a keyboard before, so I wanted to make sure it was going to work how I thought it would. 

![](11.jpg)
I really wish they had 3P3T slide switches, but the smallest package I have found for that are these mini toggle switches, still a bit big, but they will do. 

## Custom Placard and Dashboard 

![](12.jpg)
What do you know, it all works, even the volt meter!

You'll have to check for next time when we start the process of creating the custom case.
