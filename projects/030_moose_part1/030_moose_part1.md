Ever since I saw CHAPPiE I knew if they *ever* made a model/figure/statue of the MOOSE mech, I would buy it. It was 6 months later I saw the prototype for a production run for this model (saw it on Tested here on YouTube) and then 3 years later it was avaiable for sale and so I bought it, even though it was by far the most expensive model or figure I had ever purchased but I really wanted it.

## Unbox

Neill Blomkamp's movies are by far my favorite 'cyberpunk' aesthetic/genre. I love all things cyberpunk, from the rainy neon streets on Blade Runner, to the off-world colonies of Total Recall, and the slick, sleek modernity of the Matrix. Although by far my favorite style is this gritty, militiristic, camo industrial raw aesthetic, and his style ticks all the boxes for me in terms of what I love about cyberpunk. And THE MOOSE is a perfect encapsulation of that style. 

Of course it draws heavy from the original 'big scary robot' ED-209 from Robocop. To me he takes it to this higher level though, everything I loved about ED-209 but just more!

This model kit is so intense that I really am not the person to build it. I believe this kit deserves an expert to not only prep and build but also paint it. I strongly considered hiring someone to do that for me because I knew that I couldn't do this kit justice, but in the spirit of DIY and this channel, I am taking on the challenge. I know I won't make it perfect, but I'll at least be able to put my own spin on it and hopefully it comes out semi-decent. 

In this first episode we'll go over 'why' I wanted this kit so badly and why it took me so long to even attempt to build it. I go over the unboxing, then sorting the parts until finally taking the time to do the tedious work of prepping all of the parts by removing all of the flashing and extra molding from the raw parts. Even though the parts are very high quality, just about every single one needed at least some finishing work. It took me about a week to get this far and I'm documenting my way as I go.

This kit was quite overwhelming but after I spent more time working on the parts my excitement grew to outpace my apprehension with not wanting to make a mistake or ruin this project. I can't wait to see it finished and I'm hoping that the paint doesn't cut me down as that is the part I am fearing the most.  

Now that I have all of the parts prepped and ready for a dry-run of assembly I can start gathering and deciding how and what I want to paint. 

## PARTS!

![](parts1.jpg) 
The instructions are very limited, it's enough to help you out but if you're looking for a gundam-style instruction set, you're going to be lost with what you're given! Again, this kit is not for new model makers. 

![](parts2.jpg) 
This kit has a ton of parts! Most of the parts are actually very small and just 'details' and this kit has a ton of details, it's basically like 5 major, 'large' pieces and the bulk of the rest is all small greebles.

The legs are very impressive, they have been molded over a steel armature as the legs actually support the entire model so they have to be strong. The amount of details that are molded into these parts is truly incredible.

The base is equally impressive, it must weight like 5-10lbs! The detail is amazing and the weight is just absurd.

It's a lot of parts!

Just some impressive details in the molds! 

## Preparation

![](prep1.jpg)
A ton of work must be invested into prepping the parts for fit and also paint. 

![](prep2.jpg)
One of my first parts I was prepping I actually broke it while trying to break off the flashing tab. Needless to say I was much more careful after this, some parts you can just break off the tabs, some you cannot. 

![](prep3.jpg)
It's really just a ton of cutting and sanding, this took me forever to do on nearly every single piece in the kit. 

![](prep4.jpg)
Some parts you can just clip, while others you need to sand delicately down. 

![](prep5.jpg)
I used a pick to clean off some of the more intricate parts also. 

![](prep6.jpg)
After about a week of working on these parts for about 2 hours every night, I finally was finished with this portion. It was tedious but necessary.

Now that I'm done with this, check out future episodes in this series!
