Build a fast and cheap ebike in 2022! Anyone can follow this step by step how-to guide on how to make a hub motor ebike. This information should be applicable towards any hub motor ebike and help you choose and assemble your ebike conversion kit. 

This tutorial will cover all of the information you need to know, from choosing your components, electronics, connectors, batteries, and more! I am using a cruiser bike as an example but you could build a mountain bike, downhill, road bike, any bike really! 

This was just a quick and fun build for me, it really only took me a few hours from start to finish, I'm confident that anyone who has the desire to create their own ebike can do so and they should!

I've built many ebikes by now over the years (I think 15 or 16 so far), and I have some opinions and recommendations based on that experience. To me, the sweet spot in price/performation ratio is right around the 1000, to 1500 watt mark. 

With 1000W your top speed will be about 27MPH, 1500W will get you 34MPH and from there you need to bump up to 72V and 3000+ which is double the cost. To me it makes way more sense considering that 30+ MPH on any bicycle is probably too fast for most people to feel comfortable. I love big power as much as the next person but from ease of assembly, portability, and fun factor to me, these smaller builds are the best for everyone and anyone. 

\\ Parts You'll Need \\

1. The Bicycle Frame - you can pretty much choose any frame you want, just be sure to check your dropout spacing as well as axle width - typical sizes are 135mm spacing, and 15mm diameter axles. Most kits will accommodate that, but it's always best to check. 

2. Hub Motor Kit
I can't find this exact kit on eBay anymore, but most generic 1000 or 1500W kit will do, I would recommend the 1500W because it's usually only about 20$ more for it, but if you don't care about going faster than 27MPH, then you don't need it. 

2. Battery
Most kits are 48V or 52V, I would recommend anything from 10 to 20Ah in capacity. 20Ah should get you about 40-50 miles of range depending. Make sure you measure your frame and depending on what battery you get make sure it will physically fit. If your frame does not accept a triangle battery, you might want to check out rack mounted batteries. I like the triangle batteries because they are super easy to install with the velcro packs they come with, you just strap it down and it's very sturdy.

This tutorial will show you every step you need to take to upgrade your regular wired keyboard to one with a detachable cable. This mod allows you to not only choose which port you'd like (maybe you want a super strong USB Type-B!) or an updated or ubiquitous port such as Type-C, whatever you want this tutorial will show you how you can quickly and easily achieve it. 

I did this in about an hour or so, but depending on your board it may take less or more time. 

## \\\ Parts \\\

1. The Keyboard
A very cheapo crappy HP rubberdome, this keyboard could be found for free most likely at any computer recycler.

2. The port
I got these ports on AliExpress, they only came out to about a buck a piece, so it wasn't bad and they are high quality. You can get them at this link: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003019611283.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.6f454c4dbLsyoe

I saw a few other people doing this and I figured I would add it to my projects as I knew it could be useful to some people. I personally love wired keyboards more than wireless and it is handy to have a detachable cable for a number of reasons. 

The only real drawback with this modification is that the port is going to be the weakest link now and is a bit more fragile than just a permanently wired connection, however this is just about the only drawback and the pros outweigh the cons in my opinion. 

It's pretty straightforward and easy to do, honestly the hardest part is just opening the keyboard case. After that everything is pretty easy and depending on how aesthetically pleasing you want it to come out as, it can be done very quickly. 

![](unscrew.jpg)
Start by getting into the case, usually they'll have at least 'some' screws on the bottom of the board (be sure to check under any stickers!)

![](pry.jpg)
Once unscrewed you'll probably need to pry apart the clips holding the case halves together. 

![](chop.jpg)
Here is where we'll chop the cable, be sure to leave some length inside the case to allow to easier soldering of the port. 

![](wire_prep.jpg)
Strip back the insulation and reveal the 4 USB wires, black - green - white - red. Also strip a small portion at the end of these wires and tin them. 

![](pinout.jpg)
Here is the pinout for standard USB, just line it up correctly with the new port! 

![](soldered.jpg)
Solder the wires to the pads on the connector, so simple. 

![](case_mod.jpg)
Now you'll have to make room for the connector, I utilized the stock location and just made it wider to accommodate the larger port. 

![](case_mod2.jpg)
Using some flush cutters carefully I was able to do this pretty cleanly, it's not perfect, but very quick. If you want a better quality fit, cut less and file more. 

![](case_mod3.jpg)
I did a good enough job so that the port is actually a tight fit, we're going to reinforce this anyway, but not a bad job for eyeballing. 

![](hotglue.jpg)
We're going to use liberal amounts of hotglue to make sure the port will not break loose at any time. Put down quite a bit, then put in the port, then cover it some more. I slammed the top half down while the glue was still hot to add some compression to it for an even tighter fit. 

![](done.jpg)
Here it is all completed, it looks pretty good!

![](done2.jpg)
With the cable plugged in, the cable easily goes in and out without issues. 

![](works.jpg)
Testing it out, and it works flawlessly!

This could be done to basically any USB keyboard, whether it's a 5 buck cheapo rubberdome like in the example here, or a very expensive wired keyboard (do those even exist?) Maybe even an update to a vintage board where you want a newer port design. Maybe you already have a ton of cables and you'd like to take one cable with you to the coffee shop and don't need to have a bunch of different cables or even one flopping around in your bag still attached to your keyboard.
