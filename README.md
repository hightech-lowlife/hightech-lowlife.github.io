Taking it back (again) to (nearly) the beginning! This is the second ebike I had ever made and it’s a bit over the top (again). I learned a lot from my first ebike project and I wanted to make some changes on my second build.

Ever since I saw CHAPPiE I knew if they ever made a model/figure/statue of the MOOSE mech, I would buy it. It was 6 months later I saw the prototype for a production run for this model and then 3 years later it was avaiable for sale and so I bought it, even though it was by far the most expensive model or figure I had ever purchased but I really wanted it.

This is the TL;DW (too long; didn't watch) version of my 3000W BMX ebike build - for those who didn't have the time to watch the 6-part series I have condensed it all down in 'rapid-fire' pace in 6 minutes!

In part 4 we’re digging into all of the cosmetic modifications I have planned for this build. I actually didn’t really plan on putting too much time or work into making this look nice, this was supposed to be a ‘beater’ that I could thrash on, but that didn’t really work out, so here I am pouring way too much time and energy into another build!

In part 3 we’re on to more battery modifications, this time we’re cleaning up all of these wires so that this ‘pack’ will finally fit in the battery bag. This ‘pack’ was what I assumed to be a single battery but to my surprise when I opened the bag there were 6 individual packs. I had never seen a battery set up like this, and the seller on eBay didn’t say anything about there being multiple little packs split up like this.

In part two I start off by swapping the tire from the stock rear rim to the new motor rim. I also replaced the tubes in the front tire too ~ I swear by these ‘green slime’ tubes, they’re much thicker and also have a ‘run flat’ type of liquid inside that if you get smaller punctures they will seal themselves. I now also use these plastic (nylon?) inserts that offer even better protection, after doing these mods to your tires you will no longer ever have flats!

I started out this build just wanting to make a grocery-getter, something small that I could ride to the local grocery store on my break from work to pick up some food. I also was just planning on making it a beater so that if something happened to it, I wasn’t going to be too upset about it. Of course I was planning on just throwing some parts at it and building it as quickly as possible, but it never turns out that way, so I ended up pouring way too much time into it and making it ‘too nice’.

This is part 2 of transforming my cheapo stock Lenovo Thinkpad X230 into an AKIRA themed iconic red machine (Kaneda's Bike). In this final part we implement a really cool mod made by the Russian bada$$ Nitrocaster, this mod allows you to stuff in a full HD panel into your tiny 12.5" X230! Also on the dockett is upgrading from 8GB of mismatched *blechhh* ram, to 16GB of matching ram! We're also tossing in a 240GB MSATA SSD, I threw in a new 500GB SSD for data, and finally a Korean X220 keyboard!

After successful completion of my previous Lenovo Thinkpad W541 laptop painting project, I wanted to challenge myself some more with an Akira themed build. Akira is by far one of my most favorite cyberpunk anime films I have ever seen and there is nothing more iconic than Kaneda’s bike! I have had this idea in my head for a very red thinkpad for a while now and I wanted to bring it to life. Check out part 1!

Taking it back to the beginning! This is the first ebike I had ever made and it’s a bit over the top. This all started because a few friends at work said they wanted to make their own ebikes and prior to that I wasn’t particularly interested in bikes or ebikes for that matter. I of course had to out-do my coworkers so I decided to build a pretty crazy ebike for my first one.

DIY Painting a laptop? You should totally paint your laptop! (maybe), actually maybe not. Watch me take a normal Lenovo ThinkPad W541 workstation computer and give it a custom hex-camo paint job, I also ended up adding some UV printing and upgrading the CPU to a Intel Core i7 4940MX! I made a few mistakes along the way but nothing that some perseverance couldn't overcome. It was a ton of work but the finished product was completely worth it in the end! This isn't really a guide, maybe something more to inspire you to create your own.

If your camera is right over your working space it frees up a lot of space to move around and also gets the best shot possible. Making mroe videos I figured that a lot of what I would be capturing would probably be on a desk or workbench and after my first video trying to work with a camera in front of you is annoying and one over your shoulder would not get a very good shot, and also be annoying. Since you're already making something that is hovering above your workspace why not stick some cheap LED strips on it and make it more useful.
