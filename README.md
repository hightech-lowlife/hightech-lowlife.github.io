This is for those who want to take their existing USB keyboard and make it wireless, those who enjoy taking things apart, voiding warranties, soldering, cramming things into small spaces... you get the idea. Some really awesome keyboards just simply aren't offered with a wireless option, and finally (thanks to a few more recent advancements in tech) this is now feasible in a (somewhat) elegant DIY package.

My phone will automatically turn on and start playing music when I turn my car on! I know most people just use their current phones to play music in their cars and I get that, but I just like having a dedicated source that is with the car, plus it allows me to install another screen and more tech in my car and why would I pass up that opportunity?

If your camera is right over your working space it frees up a lot of space to move around and also gets the best shot possible. Making mroe videos I figured that a lot of what I would be capturing would probably be on a desk or workbench and after my first video trying to work with a camera in front of you is annoying and one over your shoulder would not get a very good shot, and also be annoying. Since you're already making something that is hovering above your workspace why not stick some cheap LED strips on it and make it more useful.

You should totally paint your computer parts! Not only is it easy and cheap, but you can breathe new life into tired or aesthetically worn components. Add your own custom personalized touch and stand apart from all the 'LTT and Reddit told me to buy this -so now I have a black box with too much rgb and tempered glass side panels- just like everyone else' out there. The outcome may not be the most beautiful or even well-executed, but at least you can be different.
