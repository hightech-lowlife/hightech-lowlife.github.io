You should totally paint your computer parts! Not only is it easy and cheap, but you can breathe new life into tired or aesthetically worn components. Add your own custom personalized touch and stand apart from all the 'LTT and Reddit told me to buy this -so now I have a black box with too much rgb and tempered glass side panels- just like everyone else' out there. The outcome may not be the most beautiful or even well-executed, but at least you can be different.
