If your camera is right over your working space it frees up a lot of space to move around and also gets the best shot possible. Making mroe videos I figured that a lot of what I would be capturing would probably be on a desk or workbench and after my first video trying to work with a camera in front of you is annoying and one over your shoulder would not get a very good shot, and also be annoying. Since you're already making something that is hovering above your workspace why not stick some cheap LED strips on it and make it more useful.

You should totally paint your computer parts! Not only is it easy and cheap, but you can breathe new life into tired or aesthetically worn components. Add your own custom personalized touch and stand apart from all the 'LTT and Reddit told me to buy this -so now I have a black box with too much rgb and tempered glass side panels- just like everyone else' out there. The outcome may not be the most beautiful or even well-executed, but at least you can be different.
